// ─── Landing hero ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Rebuilt 2026-07: the previous version read as a token/trading landing page —
// a neon glow orb over a data grid, a wordmark in a geometric sans, and a row of
// badges saying EARN REAL USDT / CELO MAINNET / MINIPAY NATIVE. Every one of
// those is a fintech signal. Someone arriving from a share link had no way to
// tell this was a pixel dungeon crawler until they pressed a button.
//
// What it is now: an outdoor scene from the game as the backdrop, dimmed and
// softened so it reads as atmosphere rather than a screenshot, the real logo,
// and two buttons. The game shows itself instead of describing itself.
//
// The 851KB background video is gone entirely — visuals AND audio. Music now
// comes from the engine's own synthesised bed (see components/MusicController),
// which is 21KB of code instead of most of a megabyte of stream, and is the
// same music the game plays, so the landing page and the dungeon no longer
// sound like two different products.

// An outdoor scene from the game rather than the world map: the map is the
// screen a player lands on AFTER pressing PLAY, so using it here spent the
// reveal before they had started. The treeline is also simply a better
// backdrop — depth, a horizon, and room for type to sit in the dark.

              with PLAY and the shorter word is what makes that pair read.
              The label opens with the visible text on purpose: WCAG 2.5.3

              control still activates it by what is written on screen. */}
