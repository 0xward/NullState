// ─── World-Map Hub (Phase 1+2 — behind a feature flag) ───────────────────────
// A game-style landing that REPLACES MainMenu when enabled (?hub=1 or
// NEXT_PUBLIC_WORLDMAP_HUB=1). Pure UI-layer swap: same props as MainMenu,
// same handlers, so every downstream screen is untouched.
//
// Design rules taken from how shipped world-map games actually behave
// (Last Day on Earth's global map, standard mobile level-select):
//   1. The map ART already draws the five bunker doors. We do NOT paint another
//      door on top — we HIGHLIGHT the one that's yours with a ground-anchored
//      ring, so it reads as a place on the map instead of a floating sticker.
//   2. Tapping a node NEVER travels immediately. It selects, and the bottom bar
//      shows that bunker's name/state (and, when locked, the requirement).
//      A second, explicit tap on ENTER is what starts the run.
//   3. Locked places stay visible under drifting fog with a padlock — shown,
//      not hidden, with the requirement spelled out.
//   4. Cleared places get a ✓ stamp and sit dimmed.
//
// Node coordinates are in MAP-NATIVE percentages and live inside a wrapper that
// keeps the map's own aspect ratio, so markers stay glued to the painted doors
// on every screen size (a plain background-cover would drift per device).
//
// All user-facing copy is English, matching the rest of the game's UI.
