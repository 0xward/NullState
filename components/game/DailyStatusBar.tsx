// GAME-DESIGN.md §5.5. Opening the app has to show, immediately and without a
// tap, what is worth doing right now. Until this existed the map showed where
// the player had BEEN — bunkers, ✓ marks, a level — and nothing about what the
// day was offering. A player who has to go looking for a reason to play does
// not go looking.
//
// It sits directly above the ENTER button on purpose: that is the path the eye
// already takes on the way to the only action on the screen, so it is read
// rather than discovered.
//
// Every chip here is backed by a system that actually tracks the number it
// shows — rule 2 in GAME-DESIGN.md §10, and the reason each one arrived on the
// day its feature did rather than as a placeholder.
//
// Each chip hides itself when it has nothing true to say: no craft running, no
// fragments left to earn, energy not yet loaded. With all three quiet the bar
// renders nothing at all rather than an empty frame.

// mechanic — and the write-ups of why it works say the same — puts all seven
// rungs on screen AT ONCE, with what each one pays, so the player can see how
// far they are from the big one. That visible distance is the mechanic. What we

// existed, the progress existed, and neither was ever SHOWN. Nothing to look
// at, nothing to want, nothing that reads as a game.
//
// So the panel opens on the ladder. Days already banked are stamped, today
// glows, day 7 is visibly the prize, and the tile for every future day names
// what it pays rather than making the player find out by waiting.
