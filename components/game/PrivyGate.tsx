// ─── Wallet and Google, on one screen ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// OWNER: *"harusnya langsung munculkan Login gmail, email, wallet."*
//
// The first version had ONE button that opened Privy's modal and let the player
// choose inside it. That was wrong twice over. It hid the three things the
// screen exists to offer behind a press — a player who wants Google cannot see
// that Google is on offer — and it also shipped with class names this app's
// stylesheet does not define (`ns-signin-card`, `ns-signin-sub`), so it rendered
// as unstyled text on a black rectangle. Both are fixed here by using the SAME
// markup and the SAME stylesheet as SignInScreen: the bracket frame, the plate
// fill, the white Google button, the bevelled clips.
//
// Each button opens Privy's modal already narrowed to one method, so the choice
// is made HERE, on a screen that looks like the game, and Privy only handles the
// mechanics of the method that was chosen.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, RATHER THAN A PROVIDER AT THE ROOT ─────────
//
// `@privy-io/react-auth` is a large SDK. Putting its provider in the app layout
// would ship it to every player on every route — including MiniPay, which must
// never see this screen and whose players would pay for it in download size on
// exactly the connection least able to afford it. /game's bundle was already a
// PageSpeed finding once.
//
// So the provider is mounted HERE, inside a component that is itself lazily
// imported, and only rendered when the gate is on. With the flag off — the
// default — nothing in this file is downloaded.

   * Called once Privy reports an authenticated user, with the id to key the

   * The id is Privy's own user id (a `did:privy:…` string), NOT a wallet
   * address. It is fed to the same deriveAuthAddress() the Firebase path uses,
   * which is what makes the promise on this screen true: the same Privy account
   * on another device derives the same address and finds the same save. A
   * wallet address would key the account on something the app cannot verify a

   * describes — account keys identify, they never authorise.

  // throws, this falls back to the modal — one extra screen is a worse login,
  // an unrecoverable one is no login at all.
