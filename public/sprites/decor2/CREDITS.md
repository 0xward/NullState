## Ambient dressing set (`amb_*.png`) + `amb_chest_gold.png`

15 sprites cut (crop + alpha-trim only, no repainting) from
`public/sprites/tiles2/topdown_objects.png`, which was already in this repo but
which **nothing had ever loaded** — it shipped in `public/` and was referenced
by no code path at all.

Provenance of that sheet is UNVERIFIED. It entered the repository inside a
single large squash commit (`01be51c`) with no CREDITS entry and no source URL,
so its licence is unknown. That is a real gap, not an oversight in this file:
the pieces are in use now, so if the original source can be identified it
should be recorded here, and if it turns out to be incompatible these fifteen
files are the ones to replace. `docs/network-manifest.md` also notes the sheet.

- `amb_crate_stack_a/b` — stacked crates, corner dressing
- `amb_barrel_a/b/c`    — sealed barrels
- `amb_urn_a`…`amb_urn_i` — clay urns and vases, nine sizes
- `amb_chest_gold`      — open gold chest; replaces the framed-coin art on the
                          `plaque_coin` prop, which is now an openable container

The first fourteen are `ambient:true` in props.js: scenery only, never
breakable, never lootable, never interactive.
