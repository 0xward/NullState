/* ============================================================
   NULL_STATE :: CAMPAIGN  (outdoor narrative beats, Act I)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Each entry is one "Act": one outdoor background, one bunker.
   To add a new bunker later, append a new object to CAMPAIGN —
   nothing else needs to change (the outdoor-scene engine and the
   bunker-transition code both just read this array by index).

   Lines come in three beats per act:
     arrival   — short speech-bubble lines, shown above the
                 player's head right after the loading-transition
                 into this act's outdoor scene. Quiet, internal,
                 first-person. Read automatically, one at a time,
                 with a short pause between each.
     preBunker — dialog-box lines (bottom of screen, full-width,
                 typewriter), triggered once the player walks far
                 enough right to reach the bunker entrance. Heavier
                 exposition / plot beats live here.
     postBunker — dialog-box lines shown immediately after the
                 player clears the bunker and steps back outside.
                 This is where the layered mystery escalates
                 (corrupted villagers, the Old Warden, the
                 infection) — each act peels back a little more.

   The overall arc (Act I, 5 bunkers):
     1. Surface story: monsters took the villagers, hero is the
        lone survivor of their own village, here to save who's left.
     2. Cracks start showing: the monsters carry villagers' belongings.
        Something is wrong with what "corrupted" actually means.
     3. The Golden Keys are confirmed to be fragments of something
        old and cryptographic, not ordinary keys.
     4. First contact with the Old Warden (unnamed, unseen — only a
        message). They warn the hero to stop collecting fragments.
     5. The hero's own condition is named for the first time (not
        resolved). Act I ends on that open question, deliberately
        unresolved for Act II (future bunkers) to pick up.

      "The entrance here isn't broken — it's open. Like something walked out, not in.",
      "These keys aren't shaped like any key I've ever held. More like... pieces. Of something that was whole, once, and cut itself apart on purpose.",
      "Fragments of a lock too big for any door I've seen. Fine. I'll find the door.",
    ],
    postBunker: [
      "Third key. It's warmer than the other two combined, like it's the closest to finishing something.",
      "Down in the frost chamber, the walls weren't stone under the ice. They were screens — dead ones, but screens. Old machines that this whole bunker was built around, not in.",
      "Whatever NULL_STATE actually is, it didn't choose these places. We built the doors for it a long time ago. We just forgot we did.",

      "A door behind the old market — newer than the buildings around it, like it was added after everyone left.",
      "Before I go down: something spoke to me last night. Not a dream. A voice, clean and old, like it had said these words a thousand times to a thousand other people standing exactly where I'm standing.",
      "\"Stop collecting what isn't yours to hold. Every fragment you carry weakens the seal the rest of us are dying to keep closed.\"",
      "I didn't ask who 'the rest of us' was. I'm not sure I want the answer before I have a sword in my hand.",
    ],
    postBunker: [
      "Fourth key. It's lighter than it should be — or I'm getting used to carrying things that shouldn't exist.",
      "The voice didn't come back down there. But something did watch me. I felt it the way you feel a held breath in a quiet room.",
      "Whoever — whatever — is trying to keep this sealed, they're not the enemy I came here for. But I don't think they're on my side either.",
      "One more bunker. One more key, maybe. And then I find out what door four fragments actually opens.",
