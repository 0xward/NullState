## Quest Objectives

To unlock the vault, you need:

   - Can **NOT be burned**
   - Capped at 1 per wallet per week (server-enforced)

3. 🏺 **The Vault** (Bunker 5 — "The Last Light")

### Step 2: Find the Golden Key

- Collect it and keep it safe

### Step 3: Reach the Vault

- Enter your 4-digit code using keyboard
- **You have 3 attempts max**

## Strategy Tips

1. **Carry paper safely** - Don't lose it before reaching vault
2. **Write down code** - Paper item shows code; copy it
3. **Plan route** - Find both paper + key before reaching Bunker 5's boss
4. **Use your attempts wisely** - 3 chances, make them count
5. **Weekly refresh** - Monday brings new code, new opportunity

## FAQ

**Q: Can I get another paper if I lose it?**  
A: Yes, papers respawn in containers. Find a new one if needed.

**Q: What if I die with paper + key?**  
A: Both stay with you in your inventory. Death only sends you back to the floor you died on, not out of the run.

**Q: What if time runs out in vault UI?**  
A: No timer; you have unlimited time to input code. Take your time.

**Q: Can I sell or burn the paper/key?**  
A: No, they auto-delete after your run ends. They're only for this quest.

**Q: What's the code format?**  
A: 4 digits: 0000 to 9999. All numbers, no letters.
