## 📊 Scoring Formula

Your **seasonal score** is calculated from 5 metrics:

### The 5 Pillars

```
Seasonal Score = 45% USDm + 20% Items + 15% Kills + 15% Days + 5% Vault
```

| Metric | Weight | Measured |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 💰 **Total USDm Earned** | 45% | Burn rewards + vault + bonuses |
| 📦 **Items Collected** | 20% | Total unique items looted |
| ⚔️ **Enemies Killed** | 15% | Combat engagement metric |
| 📅 **Days Active** | 15% | How often you play (loyalty) |
| 🔐 **Vault Codes Solved** | 5% | Weekly vault quest wins |

### Why This Scoring?

**45% USDm** - Rewards actual earnings  
→ Players who burn efficiently rank higher

**20% Items** - Rewards exploration  
→ Encourages diving into bunkers

**15% Kills** - Rewards combat  
→ Incentivizes fighting, not just looting

**15% Days** - Rewards consistency  
→ Loyal daily players get edge

**5% Vault** - Rewards problem-solving

## 🎯 How Scoring Works

### Normalization (0-100 Scale)

Each metric is normalized to 0-100 based on **the best player that month**:

```
Example - Your Score:

You:
- USDm: 8 earned
- Items: 450 collected
- Kills: 8,000 total
- Days: 25 active
- Vault: 4 codes solved

Top Player (Normalization):
- USDm: 10 (best)
- Items: 500 (best)
- Kills: 10,000 (best)
- Days: 28 (best)
- Vault: 4 (best)

→ Your Normalized Score:

- USDm: (8/10) × 100 = 80 → 80 × 0.45 = 36.0
- Items: (450/500) × 100 = 90 → 90 × 0.20 = 18.0
- Kills: (8000/10000) × 100 = 80 → 80 × 0.15 = 12.0
- Days: (25/28) × 100 = 89 → 89 × 0.15 = 13.4
- Vault: min(4, 4) × 25 = 100 → 100 × 0.05 = 5.0

FINAL SCORE = 36 + 18 + 12 + 13.4 + 5 = 84.4 / 100
```
