                NULL_STATE is a real-time dungeon-crawler RPG deployed on the Celo blockchain.
                Players connect a self-custodied wallet and participate in on-chain combat, raid
                events, item collection, and season competitions. Core gameplay actions — such as
                NULL_STRIKEs, raid attacks, vault submissions, and claiming burn rewards — are
                executed as signed transactions on Celo mainnet.

              <p>
                Off-chain game state (item inventory, current progress, season stats) is stored
                in a Firebase-backed database operated by 0xward and governed by our
                Privacy Policy.
