// ─── Why this route exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The world map's largest painted element is the player's own name, and until
// this route it could not appear until the CLIENT Firestore SDK had booted and
// completed a WebChannel handshake with firestore.googleapis.com. PageSpeed
// measured the result precisely: LCP element `<span class="ns-hub-name">`,
// render delay 7,450ms — on a page where the map, the trail, the rail and every
// button were already on screen.
//
// Two earlier attempts at this missed. Running the username and leaderboard
// reads in parallel removed one round trip but not the SDK bootstrap, and
// caching the last profile in localStorage only helps a RETURNING visitor —
// a PageSpeed run, and a player's first ever open, always have empty storage.
// What was left is the part neither touched: the client should not be talking
// to Firestore at all to answer "what is my name".
//
// So the same two documents are read here, with the Admin SDK, and the browser
// makes one same-origin GET on a connection it already has open. No SDK to
// download or boot, no cross-origin handshake, no preconnect needed.
//
// AUTHENTICATION: none, deliberately. This returns only what the world map
// already shows to the person holding the wallet — a display name and a level.
// It writes exactly one thing: an auto-assigned name for a wallet that has none
// yet, which is what the client SDK did too, at the same moment, for the same
// reason. It is not a route that can move value.
