/**
 * test-raid-campaign-resume.js — a raid must never cost the player their campaign.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LOCKS DOWN. Raiding a cleared bunker (GAME-DESIGN.md §7) shares the
 * same saved-session document as the campaign, so three separate things could
 * quietly destroy a player's progress, and all three were found by tracing this
 * flow rather than by playing it:
 *
 *   1. The map read its progress straight off the session's campaignActIndex, so
 *      raiding Bunker 1 would have shown a five-bunker veteran a map with 3-5
 *      locked.
 *   2. DungeonGame's Continue branch CONSUMES the session it loads, which for a
 *      raid would have deleted the campaign mid-flight.
 *   3. The raid's own snapshot would have reset a Bunker 3 run to floor 1.
 *
 * It also caught a fourth, in the fix itself: the campaign-resume stash was
 * taken inside the `if (raw)` guard, so any path where the engine had no
 * snapshot left it on disk for the NEXT raid to restore. The first run of this
 * test reported a FALSE GREEN for exactly that reason — the engine had not
 * mounted, the whole write block was skipped, and the assertions passed against
 * the untouched seeded draft. Hence the stub below: without it this test proves
 * nothing. The "raid KEEPS what it earned" assertion is the tripwire — it can
 * only pass if the raid's snapshot was really written.
 *
 * Playing five floors of real-time combat headlessly is not practical, so this
 * drives the SHELL half by standing in for the engine's snapshot, the same way
 * scripts/test-bunker-floor-reset.js does. It does not prove the engine half.
 *
 *   npm run build && npx next start -p 3170 &
 *   node scripts/test-raid-campaign-resume.js
 *
 * Requires playwright-core and a Chromium at CHROME_PATH.
