/**
 * check-minipay-copy.js — enforce MiniPay's listing rules that live in *copy*.
 *
 * MiniPay's readiness review rejects Mini Apps over wording, not just
 * behaviour. Three of its rules are things a normal build, type-check and
 * asset audit are all completely blind to:
 *
 *   1. Banned vocabulary. "Gas", "onramp", "offramp" and "crypto" must be
 *      "Network fee", "Deposit", "Withdraw" and "Stablecoin". Also "Add Cash",
 *      which the docs name as MiniPay's own screen but which the copy rules say
 *      not to use as *our* button label.
 *   2. "Connect wallet" copy. Inside MiniPay the address resolves with no
 *      interaction, so a connect prompt is always wrong there.
 *   3. Message signing. personal_sign / eth_signTypedData are not supported by
 *      MiniPay at all, so any call is a hard failure on a real device.
 *
 * Every one of these had already regressed at least once: an "Add Cash" link
 * label in four files, and a "Connect wallet to load profile." line on /profile
 * that was permanently visible because the card was never handed an address.
 *
 * SCOPE — deliberately narrow, because a copy checker that cries wolf gets
 * switched off. Rules 1 and 2 look only at text a user can actually read: JSX
 * text nodes, and the string values of the props that render as text. Code
 * identifiers (`gasEstimate`, `feeCurrency`, `eth_gasPrice`), comments and
 * import paths are technical and are never inspected. Rule 3 is a plain
 * source-wide search, because there is no legitimate use of those methods here.
 *
 * Exit code 1 on any hit, so it can gate CI.
 *
 * Run: npm run check:copy
