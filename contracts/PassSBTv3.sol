/**
 * @title PassSBTv3
 * @notice Soulbound Token (SBT) for NullState Season Passes — v3
 * @dev Non-transferable ERC721 tokens representing seasonal pass access.
 *
 * WHY V3 EXISTS (read this first):
 * PassSBTv2.sol (live but never usable — see below) has a fatal bug in its
 * `_update()` override, the internal hook OpenZeppelin's ERC721 calls on
 * EVERY mint, burn, and transfer:
 *
 *     function _update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth) internal override returns (address) {
 *         address from = ownerOf(tokenId);   // BUG
 *         require(from == address(0) || to == address(0), "SBT: Non-transferable");
 *         return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);
 *     }
 *
 * `ownerOf(tokenId)` is the PUBLIC OpenZeppelin v5 function, which
 * internally calls `_requireOwned()` and DELIBERATELY REVERTS with
 * `ERC721NonexistentToken(uint256)` if the token has no owner yet. But
 * `_update()` is called FIRST during minting, at the exact moment the
 * token does not have an owner yet — so this line reverts on literally
 * every mint attempt, both `mintFreePass()` and `backendMintPass()`. This
 * was confirmed by decoding the revert selector `0x7e273289` from a live
 * failed mint tx, which matches `ERC721NonexistentToken(uint256)` exactly.
 *
 * The fix is to use `_ownerOf(tokenId)` — the INTERNAL OZ v5 helper, which
 * returns `address(0)` instead of reverting when the token has no owner
 * yet. This is the exact pattern OpenZeppelin's own ERC721 uses internally
 * for the same non-transferable-token check. See `_update()` below.
 *
 * The same bug exists in `contracts/PassSBT.sol` (v1, live on Celo
 * Mainnet, not upgradeable, not touched by this fix) — meaning v1 most
 * likely never successfully minted a single pass either. Neither v1 nor
 * v2 use a proxy/upgradeable pattern, so this cannot be patched in place;
 * a new contract is the only fix, hence v3.
 *
 * WHAT ELSE CHANGED FROM V2 (v3 is a superset of v2's functionality,
 * nothing removed):
 * - `_update()` fixed as described above — this is the only behavioral
 *   bugfix in this contract.
 * - `PASS_PRICE_USD_CENTS` is no longer a `constant`. It's now
 *   `passPriceUsdCents`, a regular state variable with an owner-only
 *   setter (`setPassPriceUsdCents`), so the pass price can be changed for
 *   future seasons without a redeploy. This value is informational
 *   on-chain (this contract never pulls tokens itself — see
 *   `backendMintPass` below) but is now the single source of truth: the
 *   backend (`app/api/passsbt/mint/route.ts`) reads it via
 *   `getPassPriceUsdCents()` instead of using its own hardcoded constant,
 *   so there's no longer a risk of two different price numbers living in
 *   two different places (frontend vs contract) going out of sync.
 * - Everything else — per-season mint tracking, `hasPass()` /
 *   `hasPassForSeason()` semantics, whitelist/FCFS mechanics, the
 *   off-chain-payment-then-`backendMintPass()` flow, Soulbound
 *   (non-transferable) behavior, `TOTAL_SEASONS` (6), `BASE_URI` — is
 *   unchanged from v2. See PassSBTv2.sol's own header comment for the
 *   full history of why v2 existed in the first place (v1's lifetime
 *   mint-lock bug).
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE:
 * - v1 and v2 passes already minted (if any — see v1 note above, it's
 *   suspected v1 never successfully minted anything) are NOT migrated
 *   automatically. Per docs/pass-system.md, old-season passes are meant
 *   to stay in the holder's wallet as a collectible even after the
 *   season ends; this was already the intended design.
