// ─── THE SEASON BOARD, AND WHY IT HAD TO EXIST ───────────────────────────────
//
// OWNER: *"menurutmu pertimbangan rank skrg sudah bagus belum? mengingat hanya
// dari xp?"*
//
// The honest answer was no, and not for the reason it looks like. XP is
// CUMULATIVE and never resets (GAME-DESIGN.md §9.3) — so ranking a *season* by
// it produced an all-time board that happened to pay out monthly. July's
// winner opened August already 5,926 XP ahead of second place, earned in a
// month that was over. Nobody joining in September could ever have won: they
// start at zero against players with months of accumulation behind them.
//
// That is a leaderboard which closes to newcomers permanently, while the app
// advertises "top 10 earn USDT" to every one of them.
//
// So the money now follows XP EARNED DURING THE SEASON. Career XP is untouched
// and still ranks the all-time board — Rondo does not lose the 8,581, it just
// stops being the reason he wins next month too.
//
// ── HOW THE BASELINE IS TAKEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `leaderboard/{wallet}` carries `seasonId` + `seasonBaseXp`. On any write, if
// the stored season is not the current one, the baseline becomes `data.xp` —
// the career total as of the LAST write, which by definition was last season.
// Not the incoming figure: that would silently discard whatever the player
// earned before their first sync of the month.
//
// At rollout every existing doc has no `seasonId`, so the first write baselines
// each player at their current career total and everyone starts the season on
// zero. That is exactly the desired migration, and it needs no backfill.

  // `enemyKilled` flag, so it can only ever increment on-chain kills by 0
  // or 1 per death — a run where the player killed 40 enemies before dying
  // still only adds +1 on-chain. totalKills is the accurate figure and is
  // what the Leaderboard/Settings "kills" stat should read from.

 *     -> add the 9 new kills.
 *   - A genuinely new life started (rawKills resets to a smaller number,

 *     last(21) -> treat the drop as "a new life started", add all 5 rather
