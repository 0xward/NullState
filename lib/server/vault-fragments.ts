// Vault Fragments — the effort path to the weekly Vault (GAME-DESIGN.md §5.1).
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Old Paper and the Golden Key were pure 16% rolls on rare
// containers, capped 1 per wallet per week. Two outcomes, both bad and both
// common: a lucky player got both on day 1 and had nothing left to do for six
// days, and an unlucky one ground all week and went home with nothing. The
// second is the one that loses players — a week of effort that paid zero is
// not a setback, it is a reason to uninstall. It also produced the dead end
// that started this work: reach the vault door carrying only one of the two
// and there was no recourse at all.
//
// THE RULE NOW: luck may shortcut the grind, effort must guarantee it.
// Opening an interactive container earns one fragment. Cross a threshold and
// the item is granted outright. The 16% roll is untouched and still fires on
// top, so a lucky player still gets the early thrill — it simply no longer
// GATES the reward.
//
// WHY THE GRANT WRITES THE SAME RECORDS AS THE OLD PATH. paperClaims/ and
// goldenKeyClaims/ are what /api/paper/claim and /api/goldenkey/claim already
// write, what /api/{paper,goldenkey}/status already read, and what
// /api/vault/submit gates on. Granting through the exact same transaction
// means the weekly 1-per-wallet cap holds for free, the two award paths can
// never both pay out, and no other route needed a single line changed.
//
// Fragments live at vaultFragments/{weekId}/{wallet} and vanish with the ISO
// week, alongside every other weekly record.

// THE NUMBERS, AND HOW THEY WERE ARRIVED AT.
//
// These started at 12 and 28, ESTIMATED by reading spawnDecorInto (max 5 props
// per room, 12% of them rare, northOnly types falling back to tables on side
// walls) at 8-15 interactive containers per bunker.
//
// Measured with the real generator — `npm run measure:containers`, which mounts
// the actual engine at each depth and counts what it produces — a bunker holds
// about **7**, across two runs of 200 floors that landed at 6.3 and 7.4. The
// estimate was between 1.3x and 2.4x too high.
//
// That mattered, because the vault needs BOTH items. At 28 the Golden Key took
// roughly 4.4 bunkers of complete clearing; a player opening a realistic ~70%
// of what they find needed to play close to every day of the week to reach it.
// Anyone playing three to five sessions got the Paper, missed the Key, and
// therefore earned NOTHING — which is precisely the outcome this whole
// mechanic exists to make impossible.
//
// At 8 and 18 a four-session week clears both, the Paper lands on day one so
// the mechanic teaches itself early, and the Key falls mid-week. That matches
// the arc in GAME-DESIGN.md §4.
//
// Still a model, not player data: it assumes one bunker per session and ~70%
// of containers opened. Re-run the measurement whenever props.js gains or
// loses an interactive type, and revisit these once real weeks exist.
