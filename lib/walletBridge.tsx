// the wagmi split stays intact — but the client below keeps Celo's formatters,
// which is what makes `feeCurrency` (CIP-64 fee abstraction) a known field on
// writeContract/sendTransaction. Typed as a plain WalletClient it is not, and
// every call site that pays gas in a stablecoin stops compiling.

// ─── Why a bridge sits between the app and wagmi ─────────────────────────────
// wagmi + viem is 350KB of the 1.14MB of JavaScript /game used to load before
// it could show anything — its single largest chunk, and PageSpeed measured
// most of it as unused at that point. Fair: the world map needs a wallet for
// exactly nothing. Nobody has bought, minted or crafted yet; they are looking
// at a map.
//
// It could not simply be deferred, because useWallet() called wagmi's hooks
// directly and hooks cannot be called conditionally — no WagmiProvider above
// them means a thrown error, not a graceful default. So the wallet's SHAPE is
// defined here, in a plain React context with no dependencies, and wagmi is
// mounted later as a sibling that publishes into it.
//
// Two consequences worth stating:
//  · Before wagmi mounts, useWallet() returns a coherent disconnected wallet.
//    Reads are correct; the actions throw NOT_READY rather than pretending to
//    have sent something. A caller that can reach a payment must gate on
//    `ready` (Web3Gate does this for the two screens that can).
//  · Children never move in the tree when wagmi arrives. It mounts BESIDE
//    them, not around them, so nothing unmounts, no state is lost and no
//    effect runs twice — which is what a naive `ready ? <Provider>…` would do.
