// wallet-SHAPED id (0x + 40 hex) once and keep it in localStorage, so every
// Firebase-keyed route (username, saves, materials, energy — all validate
// /^0x[0-9a-f]{40}$/) accepts it exactly like a real wallet. It is NEVER an
// on-chain account: it can't sign or send transactions, so buying and
// leaderboard entry are gated off for guests (see `isGuest` / `realAddress`).

    // guess that lost would rename the player on screen — the exact thing the

  // can be gated off exactly as before.
  //
  // Three tiers, most-authoritative first:
  //
  //   realAddress  a wallet. Can sign, so it is the only one that can pay or
  //                claim. Always wins — a signed-in player who connects a
  //                wallet is telling us which identity they mean.
  //   authAddress  a Firebase account, as an address (see lib/authIdentity.ts).
  //                Cannot sign, but is the same on every device they sign in
  //                on, which is the whole reason the account exists.
  //   guestAddress a random local id. Cannot sign and dies with localStorage.
  //
  // The guest id is only minted when the first two are absent — otherwise
  // signing in would leave a stray guest identity behind it, and the next
  // sign-out would land the player on a stranger's progress.
