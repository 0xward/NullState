/**
 * Web3Providers.tsx
 *
 * The wallet layer for /game and /profile. What it no longer does is pull wagmi
 * + viem into the route's first load: that was 350KB raw, the single largest
 * chunk on /game, and PageSpeed measured most of it as unused at first paint.
 * It is unused, because the world map needs a wallet for nothing — nobody has
 * bought, minted or crafted yet, they are looking at a map.
 *
 * SHAPE: children are wrapped by the bridge and by WalletProvider, both of
 * which are dependency-free and render immediately. wagmi mounts as a SIBLING
 * of the children a moment later and publishes into the bridge. That sibling
 * position is deliberate — the obvious `ready ? <WagmiProvider>{children}` form
 * would move every child in the tree the instant wagmi arrived, unmounting the
 * world map and re-running every effect under it.
 *
 * TIMING: requestIdleCallback with a 1500ms ceiling. Idle so it never competes
 * with the map's own paint; the ceiling so a busy main thread cannot postpone
 * it indefinitely and leave someone unable to buy anything. Nothing that spends
 * money is reachable in under a second and a half — Shop, Craft and Pass are
 * two taps away — and if one ever were, useWallet()'s pay actions throw rather
 * than silently doing nothing.
 *
 * MiniPay requirement (unchanged): no manual connect button — connection is
 * silent on load. Only the injected connector is registered.
